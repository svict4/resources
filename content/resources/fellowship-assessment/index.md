#### The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine

# Introduction

### Philosophical underpinnings

The Australian College of Rural and remote Medicine (College) views assessment as an
ongoing and integral part of learning. The process is developmental in nature, assists learners
in identifying and understanding their strengths and weaknesses and provides guidance for
additional development. It also enables candidates to become competent, confident and safe
medical practitioners practising independently in their provision of health care to the public.

The College has developed its assessment program based on two key principles:

* Candidates can participate in assessment within the locality where they live and work,
  preventing depopulating rural and remote Australia of their medical workforce (candidates
  and assessors) during assessment period; and
* The content of assessments is developed by clinically active rural and remote medical
  practitioners.

### Programmatic approach

A feature of the College assessment process is the ‘programmatic approach’ i.e. assessment is a ‘program’ across the entire four years of training, rather than a specific instrument or assessment. 

The programmatic approach allows the College to combine assessment methods with different psychometric properties, as well as allowing for a combination of workplace based and standardised assessments.  For example, there is a balance between the clinical assessment in Structured Assessment using Multiple Patient Scenarios (StAMPS), which provides a highly structured and standardised approach, and the Case Based Discussion (CBD), which provides an assessment of the candidate’s clinical practice in their own environment. Each assessment has proven validity and reliability and each measures a different aspect of the candidate’s skills and knowledge. 

Similarly, the Multi-Source Feedback (MSF) and the formative Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (miniCEX) measure different attributes of the candidate’s professional behaviour, one as perceived by patients and colleagues and the other through direct assessor observation.  As each modality measures different aspects of the candidate’s knowledge, skills and attitudes and from a different perspective, the combination of approaches provides a more nuanced and detailed picture. 

Each candidate is required to achieve a minimum of a pass grade in each of the summative assessment modalities, instead of simply totalling the scores and achieving an overall pass score. This ensures that each candidate has the requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes as expressed though the educational objectives of the training program.

The combination of modalities ensures that each competency is assessed at least once during the training program, although each individual modality only measures competencies appropriate to the modality of measurement. For example, professionalism is predominantly measured by the MSF assessment, while applied knowledge is predominantly measured by the Multi-Choice Question (MCQ) assessment. 

### Principles of Assessment

Miller (1990) introduced an important framework that can be presented as four tiers/levels of a pyramid to categorise the different levels at which trainees can be assessed throughout their training.

Collectively, the College assessments embrace all four levels of Miller’s Pyramid (Figure 1). Miller emphasised that all four levels - knows, knows how, shows how and does – are required to be assessed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of a trainee’s ability. In other words, that candidates are required to demonstrate that they ‘know’, that they ‘know how’, that they can ‘show how’, and finally, what the candidate actually ‘does’ in the workplace. 

Examples of the assessment tools at each level of College assessments are:

* **Does** (Action):				MSF, formative MiniCEX, Logbook & CBD
* **Shows How** (Performance):	StAMPS, formative MiniCEX, CBD
* **Knows How** (Competence):	StAMPS		
* **Knows** (Knowledge):		MCQs

*`Figure 1: Miller G 1990 The Assessment Clinical Skills/Competence/Performance`*

* **Does:** 			Performance integrated into practice 
* **Shows how:**		Simulated demonstration of skills in an examination situation
* **Knows how:** 		Application of knowledge to medically relevant situations
* **Knows:**			Knowledge or information that the candidate has learned

### Assessment blueprint

The assessment program has been developed around the [Rural Generalist Curriculum](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/training/curriculum) competencies under the eight domain of rural practice. 

**Domain 1 - Provide expert medical care in all rural contexts**

### Assessors and item writers

The College has a team of writers, editors and assessors. The College aims to include as broad as possible representation of geographic and demographic membership in the team. Core Generalist Training assessment team members are required to be experienced rural practitioners who hold FACRRM. Advanced Specialised Training assessment team members are comprised of a combination of doctors holding Fellowship of ACRRM (FACRRM) and Fellows of other relevant specialist medical colleges.

All College Assessors undergo training throughout their time in the role of Assessor. 

The “expert team” developing assessment items for MCQ and StAMPS has input from a larger group of practising rural doctors. 

The College uses several processes to evaluate the effectiveness of the Fellows who contribute to assessment modalities. Post-assessment feedback from candidates, assessors, invigilators and others involved in assessment is evaluated routinely after each assessment. This information is reviewed by the lead assessors and fed back to the assessors and/or writers as appropriate.

### Code of Conduct

An Assessor must hold current medical registration.

Assessor have a duty to inform the College in writing within 14 days:

* if they are charged with a criminal offence or receive notice of the review of his/her medical registration with a view to suspension or termination; or
* if conditions are imposed or their medical registration is suspended or terminated.

### Conflict of interest

An Assessor is required to declare a conflict of interest with a candidate to the Assessment team prior to the assessment taking place. A declared conflict of interest will be taken into consideration and addressed accordingly.

### Quality assurance processes

The College utilises a range of quality assurance processes in its assessment program.

The College has a documented process for standard setting and definition of the cut-off point between a pass and fail in each of the summative assessment modalities. These are described in the chapters relating to each modality.

Following an assessment, standard question reliability statistics such as Cronbach’s alpha are considered, with reliable questions/items placed in the repository for future assessments or to be included in publicly released practice assessments. Those with poor reliability are redeveloped or retired. 

When StAMPS is delivered across multiple sites, the Assessors assessing the same scenario attend a moderator session together with the lead Assessor to facilitate consistent delivery and marking of the scenario. At each StAMPS assessment centre there is a lead Assessor to ensure that the assessment is delivered in a fair and consistent manner and that process has been adhered to. The lead Assessor will observe Assessors across the assessment session and replace the Assessor when a conflict of interest has been declared. The lead Assessor is also responsible for providing feedback to Assessors. At the conclusion of the StAMPS all Assessors attend a debriefing session which includes an opportunity for Assessors to calibrate their marking. 

As a standard part of College assessment processes, assessments may be recorded. Candidates are notified of when this is occurring and continued participation in the assessment is considered consent to the recording. These recordings are used for the purpose of quality assurance and are the property of the College. Footage obtained will not be released to candidates or the public. Recordings will normally be disposed of confidentially in line with College quality review and documentation management policy after three months.

The College formally evaluates the validity and reliability of each assessment modality prior to finalising results. Formal statistical testing is completed after each MCQ and StAMPS assessment to identify any discrepancies that may suggest that the assessment was not fair for all or some candidates. This analysis includes performance breakdown of each StAMPS scenario for each day and each venue as well as assessor grading and candidate cohort analysis. CBD assessment is formally analysed through regular year-round session review and statistical analysis at the end of each year.

The College conducts ongoing evaluation of the assessment process to ensure fairness and equity for all participants.  After assessments, those involved are invited to provide feedback via an anonymous online survey. 

The results of these processes feed directly back to the training and assessment management team, informing policy and procedure and contribute to the ongoing development and refinement of all processes. This process also provides a formal route to inform the training program about the educational impact of the assessment modalities. 

The Assessment Committee provides oversight of all aspects of the assessment process. This duly constituted committee reports to the Education Council.

### Candidate assessment rules

The following rules apply to the Standardised assessments StAMPS and MCQ:

* Candidates must arrive at the venue early; specific times are provided to candidates who have enrolled 
* Candidates must provide valid photographic identification (e.g. driver’s licence or passport) to the invigilator for verification of identity
* Candidates are not permitted to bring food or drink into the assessment room other than a clear plastic bottle of water or food required for medical reasons 
* Candidates can not take any items into the assessment room except those specified by the College, for example rotation plan for StAMPS
* Mobile phones and all other electronic devices must be turned off and left with the invigilator
* Candidates are strictly prohibited from accessing any aspect of the computer, email or internet sites, other than the virtual assessment or online assessment platform during the assessment
* If a toilet break is required, candidates must be accompanied by an invigilator
* At the end of the exam, candidates must leave all hand-written notes and exam material at the assessment venue
* Candidates must not share any information related to the content of the exam, this is a serious breach of the College’s [Academic Code of Conduct](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/academic-code-of-conduct.pdf?sfvrsn=559890eb_14) and will be dealt with accordingly.

### Venues and Invigilators

All candidates should refer to the relevant [Assessment Venue Requirements](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/handbooks-guides) when choosing an assessment and invigilator.

##### *Venue*

A candidate is required to undertake their assessments at a venue that has been approved by the Assessment team.

The venues in which a candidate can undertake assessments are outlined in the relevant [Assessment Venue Requirements](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/handbooks-guides) document available on the College website. It is the candidate’s responsibility to ensure that the minimum requirements as indicated in the documents below are met.

Assessments cannot be conducted in a private residence (with the exception of Mock StAMPS) and candidates must ensure that the room being used does not contain any reference material and all computers in the room must be turned off

##### *Invigilators*

Invigilators play a central role in ensuring the security of this examination is maintained at all times. Candidates are responsible for finding a suitable invigilator and will be unable to undertake the assessment without an appropriate invigilator. 

All invigilators are subject to approval by the Assessment team, who has the discretionary authority to approve or decline each nominated invigilator. If a nominated invigilator is deemed unsuitable for any reason, the candidate will be notified and required to nominate another invigilator. Invigilators are paid by the College. 

### Incidents or irregularities

A candidate or assessor who has a concern about the management or conduct of the assessment should complete an [Incident Report](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/examination-incident-report-form.pdf?sfvrsn=8a69d668_2). An Incident Report must be provided to the Assessment team within 48 hours of the conclusion of the assessment.

Examples of incidents or other irregularities include but not limited to:

* An uncooperative candidate or assessor
* Not following the assessment procedure 
* Disturbances (e.g. unexpected noisy consulting room)
* Disruptions (e.g. loss of power or telephone malfunction)

### Results

When all post assessment quality assurance processes are complete, a recommendation is presented to the ACRRM Board of Examiners (BoE).  The BoE meets on a regular basis to ratify results.  Candidates are provided with an outcome letter and feedback report (if applicable) shortly after the ratification of results by the BoE.

Once available, results are uploaded to the “My Documents” section of a candidate’s “My College” portal, accessible via the College website. Candidates will receive an email notification once results are uploaded. The dates for release of results are generally published for each assessment on the [Assessment, date and enrolments and fees](https://www.acrrm.org.au/fellowship/discover-fellowship/assessment/assessment-dates-enrolments) webpage.

### Public assessment reports

A report is published on the College website following each Core Generalist Training (CGT), Advanced Specialty Training (AST) Emergency Medicine (EM) StAMPS and MCQ assessment. CBD public reports are published annually. The public report provides assessment statistics, a description of the scenarios/questions, feedback from the Principal Assessor and a summary of stakeholder feedback and improvements planned. The [Assessment Public Reports](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/public-assessment-reports) are published on Assessment resources webpage. 

### Undertaking Assessments Overseas

The College has provisions in place for candidates who wish to undertake their assessment outside of Australia. Candidates who wish to undertake an assessment overseas must contact the Assessment team as soon as practicable for further advice before finalising enrolment.

The MCQ and StAMPS assessments can be completed overseas, subject to appropriate invigilation and technical requirements being met. See [Assessment Venue Requirements](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/examination-venue-requirements.pdf?sfvrsn=12530098_2) for further information. 

The MSF, CBD and formative miniCEX can only be undertaken overseas if in an approved overseas training placement. Refer to the [Overseas Training Placements policy](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/overseas-training-placements-policy.pdf?sfvrsn=26500726_6).
