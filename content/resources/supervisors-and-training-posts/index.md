## Introduction

These Standards apply to supervisors and training posts training registrars on the ACRRM Fellowship
Training Program. The Standards apply to Core Generalist and Advanced Specialised Training in all
disciplines. They apply to primary, secondary, emergency and retrieval services providing ACRRM
training.

The domains, standards and criteria are the [Accreditation of Training Sites for Specialist Medical
Training: AHMAC agreed standards](https://cpmc.edu.au/special-projects/accreditation-of-training-sites-for-specialist-medical-training-ahmac-agreed-standards/)

These standards are outcome standards and do not prescribe inputs, such as number of hours,
percentages, etc. The description of evidence is outlined by ACRRM; it provides guidance around the
College expectations for the ACRRM Fellowship Training Program.

The competencies, knowledge, skills and attributes to be gained through training in these posts are
described in the [Rural Generalist Curriculum.](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/training/curriculum)

## Definitions

ACRRM uses the following definitions:

### Training post

A training post refers to the accredited health service in which the registrar trains, under supervision,
to meet the ACRRM training program requirements. ACRRM training posts are in primary, secondary,
emergency and retrieval services. A training post may be a single health service or several health
services.

### Registrar

A registrar is a doctor training on the ACRRM Fellowship Training Program.

### Supervisor

A supervisor is a doctor who provides supervision for registrars. This includes providing monitoring,
guidance and feedback on matters of personal, professional and educational development in the
context of the doctor’s care of patients.

The *Principal Supervisor* is the doctor responsible for the overall clinical and educational
supervision of a registrar in the training post. A registrar must always have a principal supervisor.

An *Additional Supervisor* contributes to the clinical and educational supervision for a registrar. An
additional supervisor provides supervision at times when the registrar cannot access the principal
supervisor.
