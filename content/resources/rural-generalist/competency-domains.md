Rural Generalist medical practitioner competencies are grouped under the eight domains of rural and remote practice. They describe the key competencies that are required in each context of practice.

The curriculum consists of the Core Generalist and Advanced Specialised components. The
Rural Generalist medical practitioner competencies are common to both components, but the
expected standard for some competencies increases between the Core and Advanced
components.

Registrars must demonstrate meeting all competencies at the Core Generalist standard and
choose one specialised area in which they demonstrate meeting the Advanced Specialised
standard. 

## Core Generalist competency standards

Three indicators are provided for each competency for the Core Generalist standard. These
indicators are markers of progression to meeting the standard of the Core Generalist
component.

##### Footnote

**(3) Cultural safety for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples**

Cultural safety is determined by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals, families and communities. 

Culturally safe practice is the ongoing critical reflection of health practitioner knowledge, skills, attitudes, practising behaviours and power differentials in delivering safe, accessible and responsive healthcare free of racism.

  To ensure culturally safe and respectful practice, medical practitioners must:

1. Acknowledge colonisation and systemic racism, social, cultural, behavioural and economic factors which impact individual and community health
2. Acknowledge and address individual racism, their own biases, assumptions, stereotypes and prejudices and provide care that is holistic, free of bias and racism
3. Recognise the importance of self-determined decision-making, partnership and collaboration in healthcare which is driven by the individual, family and community
4. Foster a safe working environment through leadership to support the rights and dignity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and colleagues.

Culturally safe and respectful practice is also important for all communities.
