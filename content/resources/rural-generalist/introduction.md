### The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine

The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM) was formed in 1997 as an
acknowledgment of: 

* the importance of rural and remote medicine as a broad and distinctive form of general
  practice
* the need for well-designed vocational preparation and continuing medical education for
  rural doctors, and
* the need to address the shortage of rural and remote doctors in Australia, by providing
  them with a separate and distinctive professional body

ACRRM is a professional college accredited by the Australian Medical Council to define
standards and deliver training in the medical specialty of general practice.

At the time of writing this document, an application to have Rural Generalist medicine
recognised as a protected title and as a specialised field within the speciality of general practice
is being progressed.

## What is a General Practitioner?

The General Practitioner is the doctor with core responsibility for providing comprehensive and
continuing medical care to individuals, families and the broader community. Competent to
provide the greater part of medical care, the General Practitioner can deliver services in the
primary care setting, the secondary care setting, the home, long-term residential care facilities
or by electronic means – wherever and however services are needed by the patient within their
safe scope of practice.

Fellows of ACRRM receive specialist registration as a General Practitioner with the Medical
Board of Australia and can practise in any location throughout Australia.

ACRRM’s curriculum and training program also prepares doctors to be Rural Generalist medical
practitioners. test

## What is a Rural Generalist Medical Practitioner?

A Rural Generalist medical practitioner is a General Practitioner who has specific expertise in
providing medical care for rural and remote or isolated communities. A Rural Generalist medical
practitioner understands and responds to the diverse needs of rural communities: this includes
applying a population approach, providing safe primary, secondary and emergency care,
culturally engaged Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ health care as required, and
providing specialised medical care in at least one additional discipline.

  or ambulatory setting
* Emergency care
* Extended and evolving service in one or more areas of focused cognitive and/or
  procedural practice as required to sustain needed health services locally among a
  network of colleagues
* A population health approach that is relevant to the community working as part of a multi-professional and multi-disciplinary team of colleagues, both
  local and distant, to provide services within a ‘system of care’ that is aligned and
  responsive to community needs. (World Summit on Rural Generalist Medicine, Cairns, 2014).
