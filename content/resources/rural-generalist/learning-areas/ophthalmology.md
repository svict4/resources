### Knowledge

#### CG.K.1

Describe the normal anatomy, physiology and ocular function of the eye

#### CG.K.2

Identify presenting signs, symptoms and management of common eye presentations 

#### CG.K.3

Distinguish between the conditions of the eye and describe the treatment and referral criteria 

#### CG.K.4

Identify the role of other health care professionals, including ophthalmologists, optometrists in diagnosing and treating conditions of the eye

### Skills 

#### CG.S.1

Test and evaluate visual function, including: 

* visual acuity 
* colour vision 
* visual fields 
* ocular motility

#### CG.S.2

Diagnose and interpret abnormalities of the optic nerve and fundus 

#### CG.S.3

Independently perform the following assessments:

* Test and evaluate visual function including eye movements and position, visual acuity, visual fields, colour vision, ocular motility and pupillary function
* Test and evaluate abnormal eye movements and positions 
* Perform an examination of the external eye including the conjunctivae, sclera, cornea and eyelids and be able to evert the upper lid 
* Perform examinations using an ophthalmoscope, including fundoscopy 
* Measure intraocular pressure using applanation tonometry techniques and be familiar with other techniques for measuring intraocular pressure
* Assess for strabismus including the cover test and differentiate from pseudostrabismus
* Perform slit lamp examinations to diagnose and remove corneal foreign bodies diagnose iritis, assess corneal ulcers and assess eye trauma 

#### CG.S.4

Undertake initial assessment and triage patients with injuries to the eye

#### CG.S.5

Recognise causes of preventable blindness and minimise deterioration of function through appropriate initial treatment and referral

#### CG.S.6

Undertake initial assessment and triage patients with acute loss of vision

#### CG.S.7

Independently perform the following procedures:

* instill eye drops and ointment 
* tape lids to prevent corneal and conjunctival exposure
* fluorescein staining of the cornea and sclera 
* dilatation of the pupils
* pressure patch an eye
* eyelid eversion 
* irrigate an eye 
* remove contact lenses 
* shield eye 
* removal of corneal foreign bodies 
* removal of subtarsal foreign bodies

#### CG.S.8

Prescribe topical and systemic medications for eye, including:

* antibiotics, antivirals 
* topical steroids 
* anti-glaucoma 
* mydriatics and cycloplegics 
* diagnostic agents 
* local anaesthetics
