## Core Generalist

### Knowledge

#### CG.K.1

Describe basic physical principles of the following medical imaging modalities:

* radiograph (X-ray)
* ultrasound 
* computed tomography (CT) scan 
* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
* positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and 
* radio isotope studies, including the use of contrast

#### CG.K.2

Explain the indications, contraindications and limitations for each medical imaging modality

#### CG.K.3

Describe advantages and disadvantages of different X-ray views of the chest, including portable films, being aware of: 

* different appearance of anterior posterior versus posterior anterior projections 
* limitations and altered appearance of portable films, and
* use of expiratory films to diagnose pneumothorax and foreign bodies

#### CG.K.4

Describe a structured approach to the interpretation of commonly used x-rays and ultrasounds including: 

* X-rays: chest, abdominal, spine, skull, pelvis, hip, knee, limb bones, including recognising normal paediatric growth plates  
* Ultrasounds: abdominal, kidneys, ureters, bladder, obstetric, cardiac, vascular, thyroid, pelvis
* CT scan: head, abdomen, cervical and lumbar spine

#### CG.K.5

Identify normal features in commonly used x-rays and ultrasounds

#### CG.K.6

Identify common disease, emergency and trauma patterns in commonly used x-rays and ultrasounds

#### CG.K.7

Describe the appearance of technical faults, including poor inspiration and thymus

#### CG.K.8

Discuss means of confirming normal variants for example X-ray other side, refer to reference text on normal variants, interval X-ray

#### CG.K.9

Discuss the limitations and medico-legal dangers of reporting imaging as a generalist

#### CG.K.10

Describe the comparative radiation doses of imaging modalities 

#### CG.K.11

Describe risks to patients and staff of proximity to diagnostic imaging and ways to reduce these risks
