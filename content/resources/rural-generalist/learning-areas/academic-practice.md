#### AS.S.9

Manage patient privacy issues relating to clinical audit data storage and communication

#### AS.S.10

Participate in and use the results of case presentations in which the learner has a clinical role, as a basis for identifying steps leading to improvements in their clinical performance

#### AS.S.11

Use questioning and role modelling to challenge learners to develop the predisposition and skill of self-assessing their own performance as a basis for defining their learning needs, and for identifying opportunities inherent in everyday clinical practice 

#### AS.S.12
