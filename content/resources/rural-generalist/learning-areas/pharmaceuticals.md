### Knowledge

#### CG.K.1

Describe pharmacology basic science, including:

* mechanism of drugs at the receptor and intracellular level 
* principles of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs
* effect of ageing, pregnancy and lactation on pharmacokinetics
* importance of genetic alterations in drug metabolism
* effect of climate and storage conditions
* pharmacological basis of drug interactions, and
* impact of organ dysfunction on pharmacokinetics and dose modification

#### CG.K.2

Explain the principles of prescribing pharmaceuticals:

* patient factors impacting on prescribing – allergy, age, pregnancy, over the counter (OTC) medications and nutraceuticals (eg fish oil, turmeric, glucosamine, vitamins etc) 
* appropriate dose adjustments in disease, ageing, pregnancy and other medications
* categories of drug safety in pregnancy and impact on prescribing
* principles of dose titration, and
* legislation regarding prescribing and controlled and restricted drugs

#### CG.K.3

Identify adverse reactions and interactions:

* common and life-threatening drug interactions and common presentations of drug-induced disease, adverse drug reactions, and
* common interactions between prescription and non-prescription and complementary therapies

#### CG.K.4

Discuss the quality use of medicines:

* factors affecting adherence
* factors increasing risk of medication error
* techniques for enhancing medication safety
* factors predisposing to polypharmacy (therapeutic cascade) and reasons for over prescribing, and
* delivery techniques for specific medicines
* delivery devices e.g. pumps, syringe drivers
* remember the recommendation to prescribe generically where possible
* consider working with pharmacist eg Webster packing, medication reviews, and medication use or prescribing clinical audits re quality outcomes

#### CG.K.5

Discuss the range of treatment modalities patients may seek including complementary therapies
